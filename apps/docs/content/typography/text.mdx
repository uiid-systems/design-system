component: Text
---

The core typography primitive. Text renders a `span` by default and provides access to the full typographic scale, font weights, families, colors, and decorations — all through props.

### Quick tips

- The `size` prop follows a scale from `-1` to `8`. `0` is the default, `1`–`2` work well for body copy, and `5`+ are heading territory.
- Use `render` to change the element — `<Text render={<h1 />}>` gives you a heading with all of Text's styling props.
- `shade` controls color (`muted`, `halftone`, `foreground`, etc.) and `tone` applies semantic colors (`positive`, `critical`, `warning`, `info`).
- `balance` enables CSS `text-wrap: balance` for better line distribution in short blocks of text.
