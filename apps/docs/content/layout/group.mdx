component: Group
---

A horizontal flex container. Group is a thin wrapper around <ComponentLink name="Box" /> with `flex-direction: row` applied — it inherits all of Box's spacing, alignment, border, and sizing props.

### Quick tips

- Use `ax` for horizontal alignment (`justifyContent`) and `ay` for vertical alignment (`alignItems`).
- Supports all the same props as <ComponentLink name="Box" />, including `gap`, `fullwidth`, and `render`.
- Pair with <ComponentLink name="Stack" /> when you need to nest vertical layouts inside horizontal ones.
