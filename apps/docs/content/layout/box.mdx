component: Box
---

The foundational layout primitive, you probably don't need to use this component directly. Box renders a `div` with built-in support for spacing, alignment, borders, and sizing — all via props. Every other layout component (<ComponentLink name="Stack" />, <ComponentLink name="Group" />, <ComponentLink name="Layer" />) is built on top of Box.

### Quick tips

- You probably don't need to use this component directly. Instead, use <ComponentLink name="Stack" /> or <ComponentLink name="Group" />.
- Use `ax` and `ay` to control `justifyContent` and `alignItems` without writing CSS.
- Spacing props (`p`, `m`, `gap`) map to a spacing scale using CSS custom properties.
- `fullwidth`, `fullheight`, and `fullscreen` toggle common sizing patterns.
- The `render` prop makes Box polymorphic — render it as any HTML element or custom component.
