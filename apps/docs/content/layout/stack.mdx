component: Stack
---

A vertical flex container. Stack is a wrapper around <ComponentLink name="Box" /> with `flex-direction: column` applied. It swaps the meaning of `ax` and `ay` so they read naturally — `ax` controls horizontal alignment and `ay` controls vertical distribution.

### Quick tips

- `ax` maps to `alignItems` and `ay` maps to `justifyContent` — the opposite of <ComponentLink name="Box" /> — so the axis names match the visual direction.
- Inherits all of Box's spacing, border, and sizing props.
- Use `gap` to control the spacing between stacked children.
