component: Collapsible
---

An expandable content panel that can be toggled open or closed, built on [Base UI Collapsible](https://base-ui.com/react/components/collapsible). Useful for FAQs, settings sections, or any content that should be hidden by default but accessible on demand.

### Quick tips

- Pass any element as `trigger` — it becomes the clickable toggle.
- Content animates smoothly by default. Set `instant` to skip animation.
- Control open state with `open` and `onOpenChange`, or use `defaultOpen` for uncontrolled.
- Fine-tune internals with `RootProps`, `TriggerProps`, and `PanelProps` — or import `CollapsibleRoot`, `CollapsibleTrigger`, and `CollapsiblePanel` directly for full composition control.
