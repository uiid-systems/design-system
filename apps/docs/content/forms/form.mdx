component: Form
---

A lightweight form wrapper built on [Base UI Form](https://base-ui.com/react/components/form). Form renders a native `<form>` element with `display: contents`, so it won't interfere with your layout — children participate directly in the parent's grid or flex context.

### Quick tips

- Form has no visual presence in the DOM. Wrap children in a <ComponentLink name="Stack" /> or other layout component for spacing.
- Use the `useFormState` hook to manage errors, loading, success, and result states.
- The `useFormSubmit` hook combines state management with a submit handler, automatically tracking loading and error transitions.
