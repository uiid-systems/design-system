component: Textarea
---

A multi-line text field for longer-form content. Like <ComponentLink name="Input" />, Textarea conditionally wraps itself in a Field component when you pass a `label` or `description` — keeping things clean when you don't need them.

### Quick tips

- Defaults to 3 rows. Adjust with the `rows` prop.
- Resize behavior is controlled via the `resize` prop: `none`, `vertical`, `horizontal`, or `both`. Defaults to `vertical`.
- Supports the same `size`, `fullwidth`, and `ghost` variants as <ComponentLink name="Input" /> for visual consistency.
