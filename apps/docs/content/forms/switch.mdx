component: Switch
---

A toggle for binary on/off settings, built on [Base UI Switch](https://base-ui.com/react/components/switch). Switch follows the same Field composition pattern as <ComponentLink name="Checkbox" /> — label, description, and layout variants all work the same way.

### Quick tips

- Use `reversed` and `bordered` variants just like <ComponentLink name="Checkbox" /> for consistent form layouts.
- Fine-tune internals with `RootProps`, `ThumbProps`, and `FieldProps` — or import `SwitchRoot`, `SwitchThumb`, and `SwitchField` directly for full control over composition.
- Best suited for settings that take effect immediately. For deferred choices, prefer <ComponentLink name="Checkbox" />.
