component: Modal
---

A centered dialog overlay built on [Base UI Dialog](https://base-ui.com/react/components/dialog). Modal traps focus, makes background content inert, and renders its body inside a <ComponentLink name="Card" /> for structured layout with `title`, `description`, `icon`, `action`, and `footer` slots.

### Quick tips

- Comes in four sizes: `small`, `medium`, `large`, and `xlarge`. Defaults to `medium`.
- Pass a `trigger` prop to wire up the open/close behavior automatically, or control it yourself with `open` and `onOpenChange`.
- Fine-tune internals with `RootProps`, `TriggerProps`, `PortalProps`, `BackdropProps`, and `PopupProps` — or import `ModalRoot`, `ModalTrigger`, `ModalPortal`, `ModalBackdrop`, and `ModalPopup` directly for full control over composition.
