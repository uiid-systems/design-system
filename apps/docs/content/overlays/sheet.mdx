component: Sheet
---

A slide-in panel built on [Base UI Dialog](https://base-ui.com/react/components/dialog). Sheet uses the same underlying primitive as <ComponentLink name="Modal" /> but positions itself along an edge of the viewport instead of the center. Content renders inside a <ComponentLink name="Card" /> with the same structured layout slots.

### Quick tips

- Use the `side` prop to control which edge the sheet slides from: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`. Defaults to `right`.
- Footer content is automatically pushed to the bottom of the panel.
- Fine-tune internals with `RootProps`, `TriggerProps`, `PortalProps`, `BackdropProps`, and `PopupProps` — or import `SheetRoot`, `SheetTrigger`, `SheetPortal`, `SheetBackdrop`, `SheetPopup`, and `SheetClose` directly for full control over composition.
