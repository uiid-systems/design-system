component: Toaster
---

A toast notification system built on [Base UI Toast](https://base-ui.com/react/components/toast). Toasts stack automatically with a peek effect, support swipe-to-dismiss, and auto-dismiss after a configurable duration. Use the `useToastManager` hook to trigger toasts programmatically.

### Quick tips

- Wrap your app in `ToastProvider` and render `<Toaster />` once at the root — then call `useToastManager().add()` anywhere.
- Use the `position` prop to anchor toasts to the `top` or `bottom` of the viewport. Defaults to `bottom`.
- Toasts stack with a scale and peek effect — newer toasts sit on top.
