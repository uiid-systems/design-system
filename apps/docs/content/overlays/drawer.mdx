component: Drawer
---

A draggable slide-in panel powered by Vaul. Drawer supports drag-to-close interaction and can slide from any edge of the viewport. Content renders inside a <ComponentLink name="Card" />.

### Quick tips

- Use the `direction` prop to control which edge the drawer slides from: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`. Defaults to `right`.
- Supports drag-to-close — users can swipe to dismiss.
- Fine-tune internals with `RootProps`, `TriggerProps`, and `ContentProps`.
- For a non-draggable alternative, use <ComponentLink name="Sheet" />.
